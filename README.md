# weather-api-stats
Created vizualizations of the weather on a given day for 500+ randomly selected cities around the world and analyzed the resulting observations.

Data Analysis:
From the dataset we can see that the vast majority of the citites experienced high humidity (above 80%) on this day. We can also speculate that there are very few cities beyond -60 degrees latitude from our dataset as our random sample returned none beyond that paremeter. One final observation of the data is that these cities experienced relatively little to no wind this day as the speeds were generally recorded under 10 m/s.
